# Mother of all KDF classes.
#
# Subclasses of this are expected to implement the following 4 class methods:
#
# - `subclass.provide?(id)`
# - `subclass.newhash(pass, id: id, ...)`
# - `subclass.understand?(hash)`
# - `subclass.checkpass?(pass, hash)`
#
# If  a subclass's  `provide?` returns  `true` for  an id,  then that  class is
# responsible for  generating new hash  of that id.  Likewise  if `understand?`
# returns `true` for a hash, that should be able to checkpass.
#
# Caveats:
#
# - You  don't  have  to  provide  all of  those  methods.   It  is  completely
#   reasonable to  have a hash  that is unable to  generate new one,  but still
#   able to check existing ones.
