# Argon2 the Password Hashing Competition winner.
#
# ### Newhash:
#
# You can use `crypto_newhash` to create a new password hash using argon2:
#
# ```ruby
# crypt_newhash(password, id: 'argon2i', m_cost: 12, t_cost: 3)
# ```
#
# where:
#
#   - `password` is the raw binary password that you want to digest.
#
#   - `id`  is "argon2i"  when  you want  an argon2  hash.   Due to  underlying
#     ruby-argon2 gem's restriction we do not support other argon2 variants.
#
#   - `m_cost` and `t_cost` are both integer parameter to the algorithm.
#
# The generated password hash has following format.
#
# ### Format:
#
# Argon2  specifies its  hash structure  in detail  named "PHC  String Format",
# **then ignored  the format  by itself**.  See  also [1].   Empirical findings
# show that the algorithm now has the following output format:
#
# ```ruby
# %r{
#   (?<digits> 0|[1-9]\d*      ){0}
#   (?<b64>    [a-zA-Z0-9+/]   ){0}
#   (?<id>     argon2 (i|d|id) ){0}
#   (?<v>      v=19            ){0}
#   (?<m>      m=\g<digits>    ){0}
#   (?<t>      t=\g<digits>    ){0}
#   (?<p>      p=\g<digits>    ){0}
#   (?<salt>   \g<b64>+        ){0}
#   (?<csum>   \g<b64>+        ){0}
#
#   \A     [$] \g<id>
#      (?: [$] \g<v> )?
#          [$] \g<m>
#          [,] \g<t>
#          [,] \g<p>
#          [$] \g<salt>
#          [$] \g<csum>
#   \z
# }x
# ```
#
#   - `id`  is   "argon2"  +  something   that  denotes  the  variant   of  the
#     hash. Variant "argon2i" seems most widely adopted.
#
#   - `v` is, when  available, a number 19.  That doesn't  mean anything.  What
#     is important is the _absence_ of that parameter, which means the hash was
#     generated using old argon2 1.0 and shall be out of date.
#
#   - `m` is the  amount of memory filled by the  algorithm (2**m KiB).  Memory
#     consumption depends on this parameter.
#
#   - `t` is  the number of passes  over the memory.  The  running time depends
#     linearly on this parameter.
#
#   - `p` is the degree of parallelism, called "lanes" in the C implementation.
#
#   - `salt` and `csum` are the salt and checksum strings.  Both are encoded in
#     base64-like strings that  do not strictly follow RFC4648.   They both can
#     be arbitrary length.  In case there are "unused" bits at the end of those
#     fields, they shall be zero-filled.

#
# ### Implementation limitations:
#
# Ruby binding of argon2 library (ruby-argon2)  is pretty well designed and can
# be recommended for  daily uses.  You really should use  it whenever possible.
# The  big  problem  is  however,  that it  only  supports  argon2i.   That  is
# definitely OK for hash generation.  However  in verifying, it is desirable to
# support other variants.
#
# In order to reroute this problem we load the ruby-argon2 gem, then ignore its
# ruby part and directly call the canonical C implementation via FFI.
#
# @see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2
# @see https://www.cryptolux.org/index.php/Argon2
# @example
#   crypt_newhash 'password', id: 'argon2i'
#   # => "$argon2i$v=19$m=4096,t=3,p=1$b9AqucWUJADOdNMW8fW+0A$s3+Yno9+X7rpA2AsaG7KnoBtjQiE+AUevLvT7u1lXeA"

#   crypt_checkpass? 'password', '$argon2i$v=19$m=4096,t=3,p=1$b9AqucWUJADOdNMW8fW+0A$s3+Yno9+X7rpA2AsaG7KnoBtjQiE+AUevLvT7u1lXeA'
